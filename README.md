# Indian-Airlines-Data-Analysis
Using Power BI, I transformed raw airline data into meaningful visualizations. Here’s a snapshot of the Indian Airlines Dashboard I developed, highlighting key insights and trends:

- 📊 Average prices in Economy and Business class
- ✈️ Number of flights per airline
- ⏱ Total flight duration by airline
- 🕒 Flight distribution by time of day
- 💰 Total revenue generated by each airline
- 🛫 Price analysis by class and stops

These insights empower data-driven decisions to optimize flight operations and pricing strategies.✈️
